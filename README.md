## Product Positioning

​	The positioning of this product is to solve several major pain points in the traditional software development process:

- **Project**: Unclear requirements, heavy tasks, multiple functions, tight development cycles, and high difficulty in project management;

- **Benefit**: Software developers have high requirements and invest a large number of personnel;

- **Standard**: The degree of customization is high and difficult to standardize, making it difficult to take over the original project;

- **Iteration**: Excessive investment in iteration and updates, and long upgrade and maintenance cycles.

  

## Product Features

- **Low technical requirements**: A person with about 1 to 2 years of development experience can replace a technician with 5 years of experience, as long as they have basic software knowledge;

- **High development efficiency**: Reduce 90% of the code volume, with most functions implemented through automated configuration. If you are an experienced developer, efficiency can be increased by more than 5 times;

- **Instant publishing**: From configuration to API interface generation, it generally takes less than 2 seconds, and the efficiency of front-end and back-end collaborative development is extremely high;

- **High degree of standardization**: Refined simple standard rules to achieve complex business operations, meeting the needs of high personnel mobility and rapid iteration and upgrading;

- **Bug defects greatly reduced**: Through simplification, standardization, and the use of defect detection tools, defects in development are reduced by more than 70%;

- **No intrusion**: Support integration and integration with various development language framework platforms without affecting the original development framework.



## Support Complex Applications

​	There are many so-called Low-Code or No-Code platforms that are popular on the market now, which can quickly build forms and processes. However, the complexity of actual business systems is masked by the appearance of fast implementation. They can only be used for some simple applications (such as single tables or simple associated applications), and can only target customers with very simple requirements, but cannot meet enterprise level complex applications.

​	To achieve enterprise level complex applications, the development platform must meet the following requirements:

- **Application Implementation**: To be able to deploy in actual project environments, without relying on third-party online platforms, localized deployment, and adaptable to various environments.
- **Complex Business**: Not just simple business, it should be able to support business collaboration, logical operations, multi table operations, transaction processing, and third-party integration.
- **Data Structure**: The data structure is open rather than closed, supporting custom data structures. The data structure should be decoupled from the platform to facilitate secondary development and data utilization.
- **System Integration**: Cannot be invasive or exclusive, facilitating seamless integration with other development platforms and traditional development models.
